### 1. `build_index.py`
- Loads the NHS dataset (`nhs_conditions_fixed.json`)  
- Creates embeddings with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  
- Builds a FAISS index for similarity search  
- Saves:
  - `conditions.index` (FAISS index)  
  - `condition_texts.pkl` (raw condition texts)  

**Run this script before starting the app:**
```bash
python build_index.py
